    <h1>Headline</h1>

    <p>Email is not your friend. Email is a vampiric beast disguised as a productivity enhancing super buddy. It slowly drains you of all your time, focus and output by constantly distracting you with other people’s demands, no matter how ridiculous they may be.

    <p>You want to spend time with your spouse, your kids, your dog, your best friend, your animatronic clown - but no, you’re spending time with email.</p>
    <p>When you woke up this morning and checked your inbox, did email tell you that you it had saved you a bunch of time and you had the day off?  Did email do your work for you?</p>
    <p>No!</p>
    <p>Email asked if you’d be interested in buying a bunch of crap you don’t want.  Email made you attend a meeting with that annoying biz dev guy Ted.  Email added 50 things to your task list that you may not ever even need to finish.</p>
    <p>Did email invite you to a cool party that turned into an 80’s movie?  No, email most certainly did not.  Because email... is not your friend.</p>
    </p>

    <h2>Taming the beast</h2>

    <p>You don't have to live like this, and we can show you how to change it.</p>
    <p>We can show you how to build the tools and systems to make email work for you.  We can save you an incredible amount of time if you’re willing to just switch up some of the typical hat you’ve grown accustomed to.</p>
    <p/>
    <h3> We have 3 goals for our Email Hacks</h3>

    <p><strong>1. Spend as little time as possible.</strong></p>
    <p>We’re going to employ every possible weapon to decrease the amount of email we need to pay attention to which will leave us more time to be productive, and even give us some of our personal life back.</p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>2. Appear incredibly responsive all the time.</strong></p>
    <p>We’re not going to ignore email - quite the opposite.  We’re going to look like we’re monitoring and responding to it all day and night.  Spoiler alert - we’re actually going to spend far less time on it, so look at that - the joke’s on everyone </p>
    <hr>

    <p><strong>3. Destroy all the time sucking aspects of email</strong></p>
    <p>Email drains our time because we don’t process it properly.  We’re going to learn to process it like < insert funny reference > so that we’re only spending time on critical stuff.

    <span>Our Self-Concious Disclaimer</span>
    <p>While we make lots of references to using a virtual assistant it’s not just because we want you to use our virtual assistants (although you totally should).  Many of these tactics can be employed without the use of an assistant, or can be used with your existing soon-to-be-replaced-by-Zirtual assistant ;)   Changing your process is what’s important here - how you get it done is up to you. </p>
